# Milestone 5

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.

Finally, in this milestone I completed the game. Something new that I added was every time the mouse is clicked, a player projectile is launches. Also, the opponents will be able to launch its projectiles. The game is going to keep track of a score. The score increases each time the player’s projectile hits an opponent. On the other hand, the screen will display “GAME OVER” text on the screen when the player gets hit by the opponent projectiles or intersects with the opponent.

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.

Some challenges that I encountered while working on this milestone was the usage of pointers. Sometimes I would forget to use std::move I needed to transfer ownership when moving the unique pointers. I had some challenges when working on some functions because sometimes I will not understand what the function supposes to do. But at the end, I was still able to complete this project!
